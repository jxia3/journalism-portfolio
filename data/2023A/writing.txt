This semester, I dabbled in restaurant review writing, the first two opinion pieces I’ve written for the paper and a fun break from news writing. With a friend, I wanted to write a humorous review about IKEA, a place that people normally don’t consider to be a restaurant but still has quality food, adding to the irony of the piece.
While at the restaurant, it was important that we documented every aspect of the experience from taking pictures of the food to noting the “entertainment” advertisement pamphlet on each table. We also recorded ourselves speaking with an audio recorder which was more convenient than writing notes on a document.
By adding sarcastic commentary to each element of the experience we wrote about in the review, we added ironic humor which made the piece fun to read. But we still made sure to include useful details for anyone looking to get information about IKEA and explained our rating reasoning thoroughly for each item.
Often, pieces like reviews work well with humor, and I’m proud of the final story and published result.
