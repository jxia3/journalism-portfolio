For my last news story, I tackled a challenging yet fascinating topicâ€”the recent takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk and how it has affected how students use the platform. However, to write the story I interviewed people recently laid off by Twitter who revealed potentially sensitive details, given the lack of transparency about Elon's policy and the rumors surrounding his complete overhaul of the company. For example, one source confirmed the rumor that Elon fired a group of top engineers because they disagreed with his opinion.
For confirmation, I sent them their quotes in the story to confirm with them their published statements. Also, I clarified that the statements the sources made were purely from their perspective by repeating phrases like "according to." Being extra careful never hurts in journalism to deliver the best content.
