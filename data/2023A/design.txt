A significant challenge in designing the newspaper, besides coming up with creative ideas that add variety to the pages, is weighing the practicality of a design with its appearance and completing every page on time. Especially for the last cycle of the year when the new leadership team had little experience managing production, my goal in designing the front page was to create a simple yet well-formatted layout that prioritized pragmatism over excessive creativity.
The amount of text on the page also limited the design possibilitiesâ€”because the bottom story was so long, I was restricted to a layout with a column and a dominant box. I broke up the text by placing the image in the middle of three columns and leveraged the dominant story to add color.
The art also proved to be a challenge to coordinate as the artist assigned to the main story was not a part of staff. This meant I could only message the artist over Slack, and there was a lag time of several hours each way. However, we decided instead of telling the artist to constantly modify the art as the design changed we could use a simpler layout with alternative art of a few colored puzzle pieces drawn by a staff member. In the future, having artists for important pages on staff would greatly improve coordination during production.
In the end, I finished my page well before the weekend which gave the editors time and energy to focus on other pages that were not complete. While a little bland, the page was not substandard by any means, and pragmatically, my A1 design was a success.
