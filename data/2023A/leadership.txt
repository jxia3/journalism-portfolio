For the first cycle, I oversaw the spotlight about AI technologies like ChatGPT changing education. Because I had experience working with code and language models, I could make better edits to the story and suggest designs that represented the technology, revealing the importance of being flexible and adapting experience across disciplines as a leader.
For example, using my computer science connections, I interviewed an expert in natural language processing to get more information on how large language models work. I also reorganized the draft of the article to include an explanation section of the specific details of how ChatGPT works for readers who may not be familiar with the technology before diving into the ethical implications. Iâ€™m glad that I was able to help create better journalism using my skills from outside the field.
