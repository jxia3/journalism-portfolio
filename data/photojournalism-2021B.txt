For my story on budget problems in the Ravenswood School District of East Palo Alto, I visited Belle Haven Elementary School, the largest elementary school in East Palo Alto, to take pictures.
Without experience in photojournalism, taking pictures for a news story was a new challenge. I tried to follow the basic photography rules of the rule of thirds, pattern and repetition, alignment, and off-center subjects, and I ended up taking a few solid photographs which were used in the newspaper.
Taking these pictures, I learned about how to use a DSLR camera and gained experience in setting up scenes for photos. In the future, I hope to continue my photojournalism journey and take more pictures for the newspaper.
