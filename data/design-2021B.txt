After writing the Spotlight story, we needed to design a two-page spread for the newspaper with lots of art and graphics to make the story appealing.
Previously, I had only designed one-page layouts, so designing a two-page layout was a step up in difficulty as there was more space to fill. However, I was part of a great team of three people which helped a lot in the design process.
One challenge in designing the page was coming up with a dominant graphic. Since the story is about math laning, there wasn't any obvious dominant graphic to put on the page. We settled on a bar chart to represent the different lanes which I think was a fitting solution that also is visually appealing.
With a great artist to create graphics, the page turned out very well. In designing the two-page spread, I improved my design skills for larger layouts with more text.
