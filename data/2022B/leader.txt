Being a leader on The Campanile has been both challenging and rewarding. One of the biggest challenges, especially because our publication has a smaller staff than usual, has been ensuring that all articles are of high quality and finished on time. While in the beginning it was difficult, by the end of the semester I better implemented the leadership values of clear communication and organization.
Another challenge has been navigating the sensitive nature of certain topics, like the special education and school shooting stories, and finding a balance between informing the community while also being respectful and considerate of the privacy of sources who want to remain anonymous. As an editor, I’ve learned the importance of discussing these topics that may seem intimidating with the other editors and the people writing the story to determine a stance that will be best.
Despite these challenges, I’ve also grown a lot as a leader over the past semester. I’ve learned the value of delegation and trust in each other within our publication, and I’ve become more confident in my decision-making abilities. I’ve also learned the value of collaboration, seeking the opinion of others, and seeking the advice of our faculty advisor on important topics to ensure the success of our newspaper.
Looking ahead to the next semester, I hope to continue the growth and success of our newspaper among the student body and in the Palo Alto community. One goal is to increase reader engagement by implementing more column contests, encouraging people to write letters to the editor, or art and design contests, which would bring more student submissions and readership. I also want to focus on diversity and inclusivity, both in the topics we cover and in our sources.
Overall, the past semester has been a learning experience and I’m excited to continue growing and developing as a leader in the next semester. I’m confident that with hard work and dedication, we can continue to produce a high-quality newspaper that serves our school community.
