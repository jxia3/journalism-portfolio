This semester, ethics has been a big issue with our reporting. We wrote many news stories covering some of the less well known practices and policies of the district, including the spotlights on menstrual equity, special education, and school shooting preparedness, all controversial and sensitive topics.
Protecting source privacy with sources that want to remain anonymous has been important while also balancing the legitimacy of having many anonymous sources in the story and people who are on the record. I've also learned that considering the potential benefits of running a story versus the harm it could create is important.
Ethics is always a concern when dealing with conflicting interests of freedom of information and privacy and security, and it's something I'm now better prepared to deal with.
