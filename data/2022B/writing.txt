This semester, I wrote a breaking news story on Timothy Alexander returning to speak to seniors. The event was announced to the school on short notice and there was a rush from all the publications to try to cover it. Thus, it was important that we wrote and published a story online and on social media as quickly as possible.
I gained experience covering an event in real-time: as Alexander was speaking, I was sitting in the front row transcribing quotes and helping put together a social media post. Then, right after the event, I jumped on the stage and snagged an interview with Alexander. With the quotes from Alexander and a student who attended the event, I helped write the story and publish it a few hours after the event, beating all the other publications.
Even though covering the breaking news and writing as quickly as possible was stressful, I had a lot of fun covering the event. Now I'm more prepared for more real-time news coverage in the future.
