One important aspect of leadership is taking the initiative during production. Instead of giving vague instructions, I was engaged and active with helping out people. The other editors and I checked in with each person to confirm that they understood the general layout of the page. This proved to be useful because when we directly communicated with the designers, they were more motivated to work on their pages and if they encountered any problems, we could help them right away.
During the production process, I remained actively involved with all the pages that were not yet complete. After the second cycle, most of the pages were largely finished on schedule. Maintaining an active presence in production was a successful leadership strategy that allowed for better communication and increased efficiency by fostering personal connections between the editors and the rest of the staff.
