Production and page designs were more of a challenge this semester with a smaller staff, since each person needed to do one page, and people who were also less experienced with InDesign. However, we didn't want to compromise on any of the uniqueness or quality of design that are part of our standards.
It was especially important to be efficient in first determining the design then refining it in the limited time that we had in production. Thus, the other editors and I used a strategy of first determining if a design is practical to achieve without wasting a lot of time trying to do something very complex and also if a design fits the text and image requirements of a page.
On A1, for a few issues we used a dominant photo jump instead of a dominant story with a photo. This was different because the photo didn't have a story attached; instead, it directed readers to another page with the story. However, we needed to use photo jumps because we often didn't have news stories on A1 with photos.
The front page for the second issue of this year had a photo jump to the Spirit Week news story and then information about the school board election below. As this was the first A1 photo jump, I learned how they could actually enhance the page and are a useful tool for making the cover more engaging and fitting more stories on the front page.
