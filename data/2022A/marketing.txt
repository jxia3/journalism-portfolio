With experience designing and publishing the newsletter in the first semester, in the second semester I continued with the format that was successful but also tried improvements, mainly in the most important stories chosen.
Instead of sticking with the pattern of news, spotlight, editorial, lifestyle, and sports, I mixed up the order and put instead what was most relevant first, and also what had the best image or graphic. For example, in the issue five newsletter, the spotlight on football was included first since it was the most important story and had great photos. This would have increased engagement in the newsletter with a catchy headline to get clicks and a well-composed photo to get attention.
In the last newsletter, we also experimented with omitting the short paragraph at the top because we felt it didn't accomplish anything and instead only included the top stories list which we considered much more important. Constantly seeking to improve on an existing design was part of my growth in audience engagement.
