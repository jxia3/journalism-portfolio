In my article on the Ravenswood School District's dwindling budget, I balanced perspectives to include all the relevant information on the issue and used references to sources to build credibility in the article and make it easy to read.
Since I wasn't able to get many people from the district to comment, I resorted to using press conferences and external sources, such as the district's budget report and monthly meeting. In the article, I included a link to the budget report for readers to easily access the information.
Not only is it important for news to be factual, it is important for articles to be easy to read and have transparent sources for data. The Ravenswood story is a good example of my efforts in news literacy.
