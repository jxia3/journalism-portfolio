For the last cycle I had the opportunity to lead the publication as an editor-in-chief. I was especially excited to use my InDesign skills to guide the rest of the staff during production.
Instead of giving vague instructions and staying at the front of the room, I was engaged and active with helping out people. First, along with the rest of the editors, I checked in with each person to make sure they had a rough idea of the page layout. This was effective because when we personally interacted with designers they were more likely to work on their page, and if they had any trouble they were offered help immediately.
Throughout production, I stayed engaged with all the unfinished pages. Partially because of the effort of the editor team, most of the pages ended up being mostly finished on time.  Activity in production was a good leadership strategy that took advantage of forming personal connections between the editors and the rest of the staff to allow better communication and increase our efficiency.
