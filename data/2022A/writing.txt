My last news story of the year on Palo Alto's electrification and climate plans demonstrated my growth over the year in writing and reporting.
The story covered the city's $150 million proposed grid capacity upgrade plans that would enable residents to utilize electricity more in their homes for stoves and water heaters. As an issue covering multiple aspects of city management, I reached out to a wide variety of sources.
In the story, I included interviews with the manager of the city's utility infrastructure team, a city council member, the mayor, and a Palo Alto resident and Paly student.
With all of these sources, the story was overall well-rounded and balanced multiple perspectives. The writing followed the inverted triangle style, starting with information on grid renovations and moving into opinions and broader future goals.
The quality of the story reflects my growth in news writing and the journalism skills I've developed over the year, and it's something that I can be proud of.
