For cycle seven in 2022, I designed the front page of the sports section C1. With only two stories and a color page, I had ample space to experiment with creative designs and I'm proud of the final result.
Since the dominant story covered the success of the baseball team and had excellent sports photos, I wanted the photos to be the dominant element on the page. I started off by making a sandwich of a photo on the top, the story in the middle, and a photo on the bottom.
However, often it was hard to fit the photos in a long and narrow frame. Taking inspiration from design examples, I settled on using a ripped effect to trim the photos diagonally and include the story in the center.
The result turned out better than expected and reflects my improvement in design during the year.
