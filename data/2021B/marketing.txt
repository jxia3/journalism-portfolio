In November of 2021, I became a newsletter editor for The Campanile tasked with distributing an email newsletter for every issue highlighting the important stories.
A large part of the job was marketing and audience engagement because we wanted many people to sign up to receive the newsletter and we also had to design the newsletter to look appealing so people would click on it when it arrived in their inbox.
In the design, we used a lot of images and bolded text to create dominant elements to attract the eye. We also put the most exciting story at the top, and had a small section detailing the most important stories of the issue.
Creating a newsletter was a fun experience, and I learned a lot about how to attract audiences and make content appealing to consume.
