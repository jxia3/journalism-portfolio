Writing a Spotlight story on PAUSD's math laning changes was a unique challenge. First, instead of working alone, I was on a team with two other writers all working together on a big story. Additionally, a feature article is a much longer piece with many more than the usual three sources.
Being on Spotlight improved my reporting skills because I interviewed a wide range of diverse sources. For the story, we had to gather perspectives from all sides of the issue, and I ended up interviewing five people. For me, interviewing sources is the harder part of journalism and I think I gained valuable experience conducting interviews.
Furthermore, writing the story improved my writing skills because we had to synthesize opinions from many sources into a single, coherent text. It was difficult to fit everyone's often-contrasting opinions together, but we managed to produce an article that covers all the ground.
With every new experience comes growth. Having the opportunity to write Spotlight grew my skills as a reporter and writer.
